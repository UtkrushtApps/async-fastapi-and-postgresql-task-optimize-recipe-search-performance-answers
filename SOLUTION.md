# Solution Steps

1. 1. Update the SQLAlchemy model schema to explicitly define the many-to-many relationship between recipes and ingredients using an association table with appropriate indexes and uniqueness constraints.

2. 2. Add indexes on the searchable/filterable columns: recipes.category, recipes.name, ingredients.name, and on both association table columns (recipe_id, ingredient_id).

3. 3. Update the Alembic migration scripts to create these indexes and unique constraints at DB level for data consistency and performance.

4. 4. Refactor the async integration/data-access layer to use efficient SQL queries, including proper joins and selectinload to avoid N+1 query issues, and leverage indexes for filtering/searching.

5. 5. Replace any suboptimal search logic with a single SQL query that can filter recipes by multiple ingredient names and/or category using grouping and HAVING to ensure presence of all specified ingredients.

6. 6. Annotate or comment the code where the optimizations and index usage are crucial, for future maintainers.

7. 7. Ensure the DB session is always provided asynchronously to avoid blocking and to match FastAPI's async nature.

8. 8. Test the endpoints to verify that searches and filters now execute quickly, confirming index usage with EXPLAIN or real data where possible.
